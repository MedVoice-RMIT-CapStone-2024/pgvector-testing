COVID-19 Overview:

Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that cause illnesses ranging from the common cold to severe diseases like Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). In 2019, a novel coronavirus called COVID-19 was identified in Wuhan, China. It's a new virus not previously seen in humans.

Prevention Strategies:

1. Stay Up to Date with Vaccines: COVID-19 vaccines significantly lower the risk of severe illness, hospitalization, and death. Even vaccinated individuals can get infected, but vaccines offer protection.

2. Practice Good Hygiene:
   - Wash hands frequently with soap and water for at least 20 seconds.
   - Use hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol.
   - Avoid touching your face, especially eyes, nose, and mouth.

3. Take Steps for Cleaner Air:
   - Ventilate indoor spaces by opening windows.
   - Use air purifiers if possible.

4. When You're Sick:
   - Stay home and away from others if you have respiratory symptoms.
   - Seek prompt testing and treatment if you have risk factors for severe illness.

5. Wear Masks and Maintain Distance:
   - Masks reduce COVID-19 transmission risk.
   - Keep physical distance from others.

Detection Methods:

- Viral Tests:
  - Nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs), such as PCR tests, detect current infection.
  - Antigen tests also diagnose active infection.

- Testing for COVID-19:
  - Helps determine treatment and isolation needs.
  - Reduces the risk of spreading the virus to others.

Remember to stay informed, follow guidelines, and prioritize your health.
